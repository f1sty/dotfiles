2024-02-21 22:05:40	+SCHAPiE	Erus_Iluvatar: current best phone imo -> https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_1_v-12263.php
2024-02-21 22:05:41	@phrik	Title: Sony Xperia 1 V - Full phone specifications (at www.gsmarena.com)
2024-02-21 22:05:52	+Erus_Iluvatar	I was looking at that exact page :o
2024-02-21 22:06:06	+paulguy	gsmarena is consistently good for this sort of data.
2024-02-21 22:06:07	Vorpal	Erus_Iluvatar: the pixel 8 pro and one plus 12 both have very good cameras, but are way too expensive IMO. And as bea said, water resistance isn't guaranteed, but it is better than nothing. Even an old IP rated phone is likely to survive a bit more than say a Librephone with no water protection at all.
2024-02-21 22:06:08	+Erus_Iluvatar	since one of your required points is "rootable" :P
2024-02-21 22:06:16	+paulguy	hopefully they don't enshittify
2024-02-21 22:06:22	+SCHAPiE	:D
2024-02-21 22:06:26	Vorpal	otherwise librephone would be the ideal choice
2024-02-21 22:06:33	bea	everytime i look at those eurorack boxes... that's like 3k USD in one picture
2024-02-21 22:06:38	krumelmonster	anyone know whether or how google still lets me select search result language?
2024-02-21 22:06:46	+paulguy	bea, cripes
2024-02-21 22:06:54	bea	for a single voice monosynth lol
2024-02-21 22:07:09	NetSysFire	bea: so how long is the waiting list for prophet song?
2024-02-21 22:07:11	+paulguy	but it has just the perfect harmonic distortion!
